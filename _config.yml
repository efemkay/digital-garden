# Welcome to Jekyll!

# This config file is meant for settings that affect your whole blog, values
# which you are expected to set up once and rarely edit after that. If you find
# yourself editing this file very often, consider using Jekyll's data files
# feature for the data you need to update frequently.
#
# For technical reasons, this file is *NOT* reloaded automatically when you use
# 'bundle exec jekyll serve'. If you change this file, please restart the server process.

# Site settings
# These are used to personalize your new site. If you look in the HTML files,
# you will see them accessed via {{ site.title }}, {{ site.email }}, and so on.
# You can create any custom variable you would like, and they will be accessible
# in the templates via {{ site.myvariable }}.

# URL is the base hostname with protocol for your site, eg http://example.com
url: "" # the base hostname & protocol for your site, e.g. http://example.com

# If you want to install this jekyll in a subpath (eg /digitalgarden) set it here. 
# Else keep it Empty (DON'T PUT /; Keep it empty)
