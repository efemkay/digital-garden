            My insightful notes are primarily on <a href="{{'/note/00-Engineering-Economics' | relative_url}}">00 Engineering Economics</a> and <a href="{{'/note/00-Petroleum-Engineering' | relative_url}}">00 Petroleum Engineering</a>. But I also dabbled on <a href="{{'/note/00-Statistics' | relative_url}}">00 Statistics</a> and <a href="{{'/note/00-Coding' | relative_url}}">00 Coding</a> as I expand my initiatives towards big data and PKM. Follow the feed below, or simply use the search ;)

            If you want to understand further how I structure my notes, I lay it out in <a href="{{'/note/About-My-Notes' | relative_url}}">About My Notes</a>. Btw, this digital garden is using <a href="{{'https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io'.}}">Jekyll Garden theme</a> with quite a number of my personal tweaks.
