            My insightful notes are primarily on <a href="{{'/note/00-Engineering-Economics' | relative_url}}"> 00 Engineering Economics </a> and <a href="{{'/note/00-Petroleum-Engineering' | relative_url}}"> 00 Petroleum Engineering </a>. But I also dabbled on [[00 Statistics]] and [[00 Coding]] as I expand my initiatives towards big data and PKM. Follow the feed below, or simply use the search ;)

            If you want to understand further how I structure my notes, I lay it out in <a href="{{'/note/About-My-Notes' | relative_url}}"> About My Notes </a>. Btw, this digital garden is using [Jekyll Garden theme](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io) with quite a number of my personal tweaks.
