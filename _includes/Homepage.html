            My insightful notes are primarily on [[00 Engineering Economics]] and [[00 Petroleum Engineering]]. But I also dabbled on [[00 Statistics]] and [[00 Coding]] as I expand my initiatives towards big data and PKM. Follow the feed below, or simply use the search ;)

            If you want to understand further how I structure my notes, I lay it out in <a href="{{'/notes/About-My-Notes' | relative_url}}"> About My Notes </a>. Btw, this digital garden is using [Jekyll Garden theme](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io) with quite a number of my personal tweaks.
