- Permeability is a measurement of a rock’s ability to transmit fluids
	- common unit of permeability is milidarcy (mD) or Darcy (D)
	- theoretically cannot be predicted – needs to be calculated
- Porosity is the percentage of pore spaces in rocks
	- Porosity = Pore Volume x 100 / Bulk Volume
		- Pore Volume = Bulk Volume - Grain Volume
- Permeability of Porous Media is the relationship between the two above
	- Darcy’s Fluid Flow equation is used to calculate that. related to [[Darcy Law]]
	- Poro-Perm Cross plot is used to inspect the relationship
