		- for my efemkay.github.io
	- [Feeling Responsive (phlow.github.io)](https://phlow.github.io/feeling-responsive/)
		- for general website & blog
- ### Jekyll Template I plan to use
	- [Digital Garden (jekyll-garden.github.io)](https://jekyll-garden.github.io/index.html)
		- for digital garden (if i deem useful)
		- the Jekyll template with obsidian in mind really appeal to me. i plan to use this for my notes under efemkay.github.io/notes while the main url is for landing page using minimal mistakes
- ### Other themes of interests
	- [kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme: 💎 🐳 A super customizable Jekyll theme for personal site, team site, blog, project, documentation, etc. (github.com)](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme)
		- This theme is very extensive with “extended” support for markdown by including mathjax, mermaid and chartjs. I use it for reference as applying this theme is quite an undertaking and loading is slow due to loads of js loaded
			- I have trouble loading the mathjax (dev website) 1 out of 3 times i visited the page
