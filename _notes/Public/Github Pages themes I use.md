- ### Other themes of interests
	- [kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme: üíé üê≥ A super customizable Jekyll theme for personal site, team site, blog, project, documentation, etc. (github.com)](https://github.com/kitian616/jekyll-TeXt-theme)
		- This theme is very extensive with ‚Äúextended‚Äù support for markdown by including mathjax, mermaid and chartjs. I use it for reference as applying this theme is quite an undertaking and loading is slow due to loads of js loaded
			- I have trouble loading the mathjax (dev website) 1 out of 3 times i visited the page
