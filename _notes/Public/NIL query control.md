- #### Obsidian Query Control key feature is its ability to show results as rendered markdown
	- Obsidian Query Control primarily meant to give greater control for Obsidian’s built-in query. However, the biggest selling point would be its ability to render the results in rendered markdown format (aka html)
- #### Syntax to control the query
	````prose
	```query
	path: foo tag:#obsidian
	title: custom query name
	collapsed: true | false
	context: true | false
	hideTitle: true | false
	hideResults: true | false
	renderMarkdown: true | false
	sort: alphabetical | alphabeticalReverse | byModifiedTime | byModifiedTimeReverse | byCreatedTime | byCreatedTimeReverse
	```
	````
