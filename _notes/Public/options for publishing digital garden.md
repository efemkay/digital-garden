title: options for publishing digital garden
---

- ### Jekyll (purely) Based
	- #### Jekyll Garden by Jekyll-Garden
		- [Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io](https://github.com/Jekyll-Garden/jekyll-garden.github.io)
			- sample site: [Jekyll Garden - Jekyll Garden (jekyll-garden.github.io)](https://jekyll-garden.github.io/)
		- **Search** | **DarkMode** | **Backlinks** | ~~Tags~~ | ~~Graph~~
		- ##### Personal Notes
			- I prefer this as I‚Äôm more comfortable with Jekyll and few standalone javascripts ‚Äì my personal website is also using a Jekyll theme.
			- But what‚Äôs also good is that it is a self-contain digital garden platform using purely Jekyll, depending heavily on Liquid templating ‚Äì so the source and deployment are simply using github.io
			- I have confidence that I can do tags page similar to how most Jekyll blogging themes ‚Äì just need to figure out how to move the hashtag in notes into YAML for the use in tags page.
- ### Jekyll with Netlify
	- #### Obsidian Digital Garden by oleeskild
		- [oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden (github.com)](https://github.com/oleeskild/Obsidian-Digital-Garden)
			- [oleeskild/digitalgarden (github.com)](https://github.com/oleeskild/digitalgarden)
			- sample site: [Set up your own digital garden (ole.dev)](https://notes.ole.dev/set-up-your-digital-garden/)
		- ~~Search~~ | **DarkMode** | ~~Backlinks~~ | ~~Tags~~ | ~~Graph~~
		- ##### Personal Notes
			- It requires Obsidian community plugin to deploy to Netlify as it make certain changes to YAML before pushing it to your github repo hosting the source files
				- definitely can manually add that, but since this template lack quite a number of key features to me, not worth it to pursue ‚Äì i‚Äôll just keep in view in case things changes
	- #### Digital Garden Jekyll by maximevaillancourt 
		- [maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template)
			- sample site: [My digital garden (digital-garden-jekyll-template.netlify.app)](https://digital-garden-jekyll-template.netlify.app/)
		- ~~Search~~ | ~~DarkMode~~ | **Backlinks** | ~~Tags~~ | **Graph**
		- ##### Personal Notes
			- require Jekyll and Netlify (to deploy)
	- #### Simply Jekyll by raghudotcc
		- [raghudotcc/simply-jekyll](https://github.com/raghudotcc/simply-jekyll)
			- sample site: [Simply Jekyll (simply-jekyll.netlify.app)](https://simply-jekyll.netlify.app/)
		- **Search** | ~~DarkMode~~ | **Backlinks** | **Tags** | ~~Graph~~
		- ##### Personal Notes
			- require Jekyll and Netlify
			- source for Jekyll Garden above (all the hard work of converting wiki-links are done by this theme)
- ### Hugo Based
	- #### Quartz by jackyzha0
		- [jackyzha0/quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)
			- sample site: [Quartz 3.2 (jzhao.xyz)](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/)
		- **Search** | **DarkMode** | **Backlinks** | ~~Tags~~ | **Graph**
		- ##### Personal Notes
			- It requires Hugo and uses Github Action to call hugo scripts to convert markdown to html (repo on the links below)
				- [jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian: simple GitHub action to parse Markdown Links into a .json file for Hugo](https://github.com/jackyzha0/hugo-obsidian) ‚Äì but the repo already has it all set up
				- alternatively, Netlify offer Hugo converters as part of the deployment options
			- This setup seems almost perfect to me except that how it is configured will require relative path as part of the wiki-links. Not ideal for me as I‚Äôm using ‚Äúshortest path‚Äù option in Obsidian
				- I‚Äôve never done Hugo scripting before, so at the moment will depend on feature request to the dev
			- additional note
				- [Publishing your Obsidian Vault Online with Quartz (brandonkboswell.com)](https://brandonkboswell.com/blog/Publishing-your-Obsidian-Vault-Online-with-Quartz/)
- ### Gatsby Based
	- #### Gatsby Garden by binnyva
		- [binnyva/gatsby-garden](https://github.com/binnyva/gatsby-garden)
			- example site ‚Äì [Digital Zen Garden : Home (binnyva.com)](https://notes.binnyva.com/)
		- **Search** | **DarkMode** | **Backlinks** | **Tags** | **Graph**
		- ##### Personal Notes
			- I really really love this implementation of digital garden as it has all the key features I cherish and implemented them quite well
				- it has search prominent at the nav bar (but somehow totally hidden in mobile view ‚Äì possibly can change that with css)
				- page preview that actually loads entire page (not just like first 150 chars) and a full html page with links clickable in the preview itself
				- it has local graph that works okay on mobile
			- But I won‚Äôt be using this anytime soon because of some (not many) quirkiness of gatsbyjs and the need to deploy using Netlify
				- I‚Äôm now very comfortable with Jekyll and Github.io that I don‚Äôt feel like investing more time learning new language/templating just to for hosting my notes ‚Äì I would rather spend that time learning Python for my big data analysis
