> - What Causes Autism?
> 	- Autism has no single cause. It was once thought to be a psychological disorder caused by traumatic experiences, leading to emotional and social withdrawal. Today, researchers believe that several genes, possibly in combination with environmental factors, may contribute to autism.
> 	- Some studies of individuals with autism have also shown abnormalities in several regions of the brain, including the cerebellum, amygdala, and hippocampus. While these findings are substantial, they require further study.
> - How can Autism be treated? [[Autism Intervention]]
> 	- currently no cure for autism.
> 	- appropriate interventions can positively change autism’s associated behaviors.
> 	- early intervention can significantly improve the quality of life for the individuals.
> - Transition to Adulthood [[Autism Intervention#Transition for severe case]]
> 	- Better understand what types of work and post-secondary schooling are best suited for autistic individuals
> 	  Plan for the transition period when an autistic individual reaches the age of 21 and begins to transition from the assistance of the public school system to adult services.
> - Autism through the Lifespan
> 	- The Autism Society promotes early identification and access to effective treatments before age 3. Autism behaviors can become apparent as early as 18 months, and parents should investigate as soon as they suspect autism or another developmental issue.
> 	- it is important to understand how the school system can help (for example, through an Individualized Education Plan) and how to prepare for the transition to adult life.
