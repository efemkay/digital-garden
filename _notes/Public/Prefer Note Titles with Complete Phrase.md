> summary from Andy Matuschak’s note

- #### Complete phrases as note title forces us to be convicted with the statement

		- contra Evergreen notes should be atomic.

- #### Questions also make good note titles because that position creates pressure to make the question get to the core of the matter.
	- Some questions really are evergreen (To what extent is exceptional ability heritable?); others are more ephemeral creative prompts (How might the mnemonic medium enable readers in genres outside platform knowledge?).

> - use nouns and noun phrases in note titles only to define core terms
> 	- (which other notes generally orbit around). Examples: Executable strategy, Enacted experience, Enabling environment
> 	- Outline notes (see Create speculative outlines while you write) like §Note-writing systems
> 	- For more, see Taxonomy of note types
