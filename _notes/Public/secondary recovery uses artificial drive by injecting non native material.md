title: secondary recovery uses artificial drive by injecting non native material

- #### Secondary recovery is the result of human intervention – either by injecting water or gas
	- for water, there are two approach i.e. water injection vs water flooding. Water injection is injection of water surrounding the reservoir to provide a “squeeze” effect

	- gas injection

	- ##### ==Leaky Piston Like Displacement== is the more realistic model to represent the water injection to oil production, where the majority of the oil is displaced ahead of the flood front
		- This means that you will have to do a significant water injection before seeing the results from improved oil production. It also means the liquid displacement is not 1:1 ratio.
		- Alternative to this is the Piston Like Displacement where the model assumption is that you will see impact immediately with 1:1 ratio. This is optimistic view that’s applicable only on select scenarios.
- #### Tertiary recovery are techniques that are beyond what is considered conventional at a reference time
	- examples: miscible or immiscible gas flooding, chemical flooding, thermal and microbial methods

> [!info] General Note on Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Recovery
> - Primary recovery uses reservoir internal pressure to push oil to the surface
> - Secondary recovery relies on water or natural gas (artificial) injection to push more oil to the surface
> - Tertiary recovery uses injection techniques that’s not current conventional and alters the PVT of the reservoir like chemical, heat or microbes to thin out the remaining oil
