## Overview
- #### **Swanson’s rule of thumb** says that the mean of a **moderately skewed** probability distribution can be approximated by the weighted average of the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentile, with weights 0.3, 0.4, and 0.3 respectively.
	- Because it is based on percentiles, the rule is robust to outliers. Swanson’s rule is used in the oil and gas industry, but I don’t believe it’s widely known outside of that sector.
	- Evaluation of the possible range of reserves associated with a prospect is a key part of risk taking in hydrocarbon exploration.
	- The challenge of presenting a range of geologically possible models for a range of prospect reserve estimates is addressed using Swanson's 30-40-30 rule.
- #### Swanson's rule defines the mean as 0.3P(10) + 0.4P(50) + 0.3P(90), and provides a good approximation to the mean values for modestly skewed distributions.
	- Applications of the rule to a historical field size distribution and a specific prospect evaluation demonstrate its efficacy in handling routine problems in hydrocarbon exploration, with particular reference to use with the lognormal distribution.
