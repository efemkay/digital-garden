title: PARA helps organising based on actionability
---
- #### PARA is a organisation approach that prioritise file/notes actionability by introducing top level groups as such
	- PARA stands for Project, Areas of Life, Resources and Archives, and the order also reflect level of actionability
		- Project → Areas → Resources → Archives
	- Project is for time-bound group of activities, similar to [[Getting Things Done|GTD]]‘s concept of project
	- Areas are documents that will be continuous basis (like Finance)
		- this relate very well to Johnny Decimal system
	- Resources are for materials that do not belong either Project or Areas – relating to items that are being referenced
	- i use References instead for this part and define it as materials that i do not produce and not related to a Project
- #### I find PARA organisation method aligned very well with my preferred task management approached i.e. [[Getting Things Done|GTD]]
	- GTD approach to identify series of tasks and group it as a project make sense to me and PARA complement it really well (mostly because Tiago Forte is influenced by it)
