## Transition (for severe case)
- One of the critical times comes when individuals with ASD and their families begin to look to the future. The transition from high school to continuing study or employment can be made easier through transition planning, which must be included in the child’s educational program, beginning at age 14.
- With good transition planning, a student with ASD can have an opportunity to experience higher education, employment, and independent living. Parents, school officials and agency personnel work together to make the transition as smooth as possible for the student.
- As adults, some individuals select occupations that involve routines and don’t need a great deal of social interaction. Remaining deficits can interfere with the achievement of job status related to their educational level. Some adults with ASD have jobs in areas such as data entry, medical transcription, janitorial services, chemistry, piano tuning, computer analysis, and bookkeeping. Others work in supported or sheltered employment.
- It is important for families to plan for adult services years before the individual reaches the age of 21. There may be long waiting lists for services, and navigating the maze of services can be a challenge. For more information on transitional services contact your state Division of Vocational Rehabilitation.
