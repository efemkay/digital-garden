title: Low Mid High cases is more suitable for MEFS estimation due to its linearity
---

- #### If data points for NPV vs volume are closer together, it is safe to use linear regression to find MEFS but consideration must be made to test for the best fit model
	- Choose the best fit model by testing the points with both linear (value closer to the mean) and log-based (P10-P50-P90) regression line
	- In volume/resource estimates, P10-P50-P90 probability distribution are likely to be lognormal â€“ as such, the characteristic is expected to carry through for NPV vs Volume comparison
		- resource estimation is derived from probability multiplication of several probability distribution representing the charge, storage and entrapment (see [[Classification of Prospective Resources]] and [[Resources Estimation Techniques]])
	- this calculation is critical in determining the MEFS which will determine the [[Probability of Commercial Success]]

## Things to do
- get some sampling on estimates based on low mid high as well as P10 P50 P90
	- this need to be based on NPV vs recoverable
