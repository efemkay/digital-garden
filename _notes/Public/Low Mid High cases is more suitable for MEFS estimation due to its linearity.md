- #### In resource estimates, P10-P50-P90 probability distribution are likely to be lognormal â€“ as such, the characteristic is also expected for NPV vs Volume
	- resource estimation is derived from probability multiplication of several probability distribution representing the charge, storage and entrapment (see [[Classification of Prospective Resources]] and [[Resources Estimation Techniques]])
- #### If P10-P50-P90 data points for NPV vs volume are closer together, it is safe to use linear regression but best fit model should still be tested
	- Due diligence must be done to ensure the assumption that data points that are closer together are somewhat linear is true.
	- Choose the best fit model by testing the points with both linear (value closer to the mean) and log-based (P10-P50-P90) regression line. This calculation is critical in determining the MEFS which will determine the [[Probability of Commercial Success]]

- #### Alternatively, a single technical input (typically the P50 estimates) can be used as a base while the other two points are derived using proper correlation
	- Reserves/production can estimated by simple variation (e.g. +/- 20%) combined with proper correlation for costs.
	- Capex estimates can utilise sixth-tenth power rule while for Opex can utilise the percentages of Capex approach (see [[Opex Forecast Methodology]]).
