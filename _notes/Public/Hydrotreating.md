title: Hydrotreating

- What is it?
	- processes aim at the removal of impurities such as sulfur and nitrogen from distillate fuels (naphtha, kerosene, and diesel)
		- by treating the feed with hydrogen at elevated temperature and pressure in the presence of a catalyst.
	- has been extended in recent years to atmospheric resids to reduce the sulfur and metal content of resids for producing low-sulfur fuel oils.
- Operating conditions of treatment are a function of:
	1. type of feed. Feed types considered here are
		- Naphtha
		- Kerosene
		- Gas oils
		- Atmospheric resids or reduced crudes. 
	2. the desulfurization levels desired in the treated product.
- The principal impurities to be removed are
	- Sulfur
	- Nitrogen
	- Oxygen
	- [[Olefins]]
