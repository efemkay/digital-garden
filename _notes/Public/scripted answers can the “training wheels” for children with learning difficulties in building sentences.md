- #### Script answers help remove friction for the child to answer comprehension questions especially in the initial stage
	- Children with learning difficulties may also feel overwhelm to build sentences, as such having a script of answers may help them build “inventory” of answering sentences.
	- Having the script also help breakdown process and allow them to focus on understanding the question rather than overwhelming them with the need to building the sentences – This will also allow them to reuse the structure for future use
