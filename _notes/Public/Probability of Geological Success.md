- #### Probability of geological success ($P_g$) depends on charge, storage and entrapment but it does not guarantee that the discovery is economical
	- More details on charge, storage and entrapment here – [[Classification of Prospective Resources]]
	- Every expression in the expected value equation requires a responsible geotechnical estimate. 
- #### For exploratory prospects, the recommended procedure is to express confidence independently in four critical geological aspects of any prospect:
	- What is the probability (or confidence) that
		- ==reservoir rock is present== of sufficient porosity and permeability to be productive
			- does it have some minimal thickness and extent sufficient to contain detectable (i.e., measurable) quantities of mobile hydrocarbons, or to tempt a prudent onshore domestic operator to attempt a completion?
		- ==hydrocarbons are present== in the subsurface geological environment
			- does the prospect has had access to them in some quantity to provide at least some modicum of **hydrocarbon charge?**
		- ==sealed trap exists== based on the lithologic combinations and structural configurations depicted
			- does the trapping configuration was already formed when hydrocarbons were migrating into the area of the prospect?
		- that the **geological structure** of the reservoir objective is, in reality, essentially as represented on maps and [cross sections](https://wiki.aapg.org/Cross_section "Cross section")?
	- The potential prospect includes shallow pool, deeper pool, and extension wildcats, commonly managed by development geologists)
