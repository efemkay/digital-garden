- #### Dethatch help to keep grass healthy and growing
	- youâ€™ll need to dethatch the lawn once the thatch reaches one-half inches in thickness.
	- **What is thatch?** Thatch is a term used to describe a layer of dead grass that sits on the soil and in-between the healthy blades. Too much thatch can stunt new growth.
- #### How Do You Dethatch a Lawn?
	- Grab a de-thatching rake, which has smaller and more rigid teeth than a leaf rake
		- Use the rake to break up the thatch and free it from the soil and healthy blades
		- Dethatching machines known as vertical mowers, verticutters, dethatchers, or power rakes have vertically spinning blades which pull some of the material to the surface as they slice the thatch layer.
	- What not to do?
		- DO NOT attempt to remove the entire thatch layer in one treatment
		- DO NOT dethatch when **soil is wet**
		- ONLY dethatch a lawn **when it is needed** rather than on a routine basis.
