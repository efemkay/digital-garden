title: it is more fair to compare lease vs borrow instead of buy
---
- #### Comparing leasing to purchase with borrowing will put the two on same level in term of advantage (delaying investment) and risk (leveraging)
	- Tax and interests rate advantage due to borrowing (see [[leasing in oil project is akin to financial borrowing]]) may make it more attractive to leasing if one can secure more favourable interests rate
	- Thus, to evaluate a lease correctly, we should compare it to purchasing the asset using an equivalent amount of leverage.
- #### There are two main method to fairly compare lease vs buy
    - 1st method is to compare **lease** against **buy with borrowed fund**.
        - This is because leasing is **a form of financing**. This method is usually known as **lease-equivalent loan**.
        - for this method, (1) find the incremental cash flow of lease-buy, (2) discount the cash flow by company's after-tax cost of debt. If it's negative lease is not attractive.
    - 2nd method is to **de-lever the lease**
        - this is done by converting the lease payment into **equivalent initial capex** as if it is a buy.
        - for this method, (1) discount the lease payment by company's after-tax cost of debt, (2) deduct the equivalent capex from the net cash flow, and (3) add back the lease payment to the net cash flow.
