title: differences between correlation and regression
---

**Key similarities** 

-   Both quantify the direction and strength of the relationship between two numeric variables.
-   When the correlation (r) is negative, the regression slope (b) will be negative. 
-   When the correlation is positive, the regression slope will be positive. 
-   The correlation squared (r2 or [R2](https://www.graphpad.com/guides/prism/8/curve-fitting/reg_intepretingnonlinr2.htm)) has special meaning in simple linear regression. It represents the proportion of variation in Y explained by X.

**Key differences** 

-   Regression attempts to establish how X causes Y to change and the results of the analysis will change if X and Y are swapped. With correlation, the X and Y variables are interchangeable.
-   Regression assumes X is fixed with no error, such as a dose amount or temperature setting. With correlation, X and Y are typically both random variables*, such as height and weight or blood pressure and heart rate. 
-   Correlation is a single statistic, whereas regression produces an entire equation.

**Similarities:**

-   Both quantify the direction of a relationship between two variables.
-   Both quantify the strength of a relationship between two variables.

**Differences:**

-   Regression is able to show a cause-and-effect relationship between two variables. Correlation does not do this.
-   Regression is able to use an equation to predict the value of one variable, based on the value of another variable. Correlation does not does this.
-   Regression uses an equation to quantify the relationship between two variables. Correlation uses a single number.
