- It is calculated as $RMSE=\frac{1}{n}\sum(\hat{y}_{i}â€“y_{i})^{2}$
- #### Formula References
	- $R^2= SSR/SST$
	- $SSR = \sum (\hat{y}_{i}-\bar{y})^{2}$
		- this expected (or explained) deviation from the mean, explaining part of the deviation
	- $SSE = \sum (y_{i}-\hat{y}_{i})^{2}$
		- this is **unexplained deviation** from the mean
	- $SST=SSR+SSE=\sum(y_{i}-\bar{y})^{2}$
