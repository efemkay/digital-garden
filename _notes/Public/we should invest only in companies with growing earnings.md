- #### Companies without growing earnings will not last long due to inflation eating away ability to sustain talents in the company
	- If we were to invest in a company (either through shares or direct ownership), we should be expecting the return to at least beat the inflation.
	- Without growth in earnings, any dividend payment cannot be reliably expected to sustain, let alone grow. Similarly for expected share price when we want to sell it
