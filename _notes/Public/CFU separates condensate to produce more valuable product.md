title: CFU separates condensate to produce more valuable product
aliases: [Condensate Fractionation Unit]
---

- #LiteratureNote 
- #### CFU is a fractionation unit separates the chemical compound (in this case, condensate) by applying heat with a goal to produce a more valuable product
	- It is meant to separate the mixture of [[What is Condensate|natural gas liquids (NGL)]] and produce a more profitable products such as **LPG** and **Naphtha**.
	- LPG and Naphtha has more valuable industrial use and highly sought as feedstock for specialty chemical
- The goal of the alternate **condensate** fractionation unit (**CFU**) design was to reduce equipment count and save capital and/or to reduce energy consumption for opex savings, especially when upstream of combined naphtha and diesel [[Hydrotreating|hydrotreating]] (CHT). [^1]
