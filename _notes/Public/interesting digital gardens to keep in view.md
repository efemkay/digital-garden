title: interesting digital gardens to keep in view
---

- #### As I continue to tend my digital garden ([Efemkay's Digital Garden](https://efemkay.github.io/digital-garden/)), I also increasing interested to see how others develop their digital gardens
	- my intent is to find digital garden that focus more on technical knowledge, similar to mine (that focus primarily on [[00 Engineering Economics]] and [[00 Petroleum Engineering]])
- #### So far here is a list of digital garden I’m interested in (possibly)
	- [Taking notes with Obsidian (twelvetables.blog)](https://www.twelvetables.blog/taking-notes-with-obsidian/)
	- [The Refined Mind (tannenbaum.netlify.app)](https://tannenbaum.netlify.app/)
	- [Fiction Becomes Fact](https://fictionbecomesfact.com/)
	- [About these notes (azlen.me)](https://notes.azlen.me/g3tibyfv/)
		- it has sliding pane (possibly just using css) similar to [About these notes (andymatuschak.org)](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes)
	- [About these notes - @aravindballa's notes](https://notes.aravindballa.com/)
	- [A gardening guide for your mind • Mental Nodes](https://www.mentalnodes.com/a-gardening-guide-for-your-mind)
- #### Additionally, I also somewhat keep a list of [[options for publishing digital garden]]
