- #### _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ bacteria commonly cause mild infections of the respiratory system (the parts of the body involved in breathing).
	- The most common illness caused by these bacteria, especially in children, is tracheobronchitis (chest cold).
	- Lung infections caused by _M. pneumoniae_ are sometimes referred to as “walking pneumonia” and can cause more serious lung infections that require care in a hospital
- #### _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_ outbreaks occur mostly in crowded settings.
	- infections are most common in young adults and school-aged children, but can affect anyone.
	- People living and working in crowded settings are at increased risk
- If you're infected with _Mycoplasma pneumoniae_, you may get symptoms like:
	- [Sore throat](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/understanding-sore-throat-basics)
	- [Cough](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/cough-relief-12/slideshow-cough-treatments)
	- Fever
	- [Fatigue](https://www.webmd.com/women/guide/why-so-tired-10-causes-fatigue)
	- [Headache](https://www.webmd.com/migraines-headaches/migraines-headaches-migraines)
- #### Mycoplasma pnuemoniae infections are generally mild and can be treated with antibiotics but some may need neb treatment
	- Doctor may prescribe a nebulizer for a child who has a respiratory infection, such as bronchiolitis. [^1]
	- For antibiotics, doctor may suggest one of these types
		- Macrolides such as [azithromycin](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/mono-3223-AZITHROMYCIN+250%2f500+MG+-+ORAL.aspx?drugid=1527&drugname=Azithromycin+Oral) ([ZIthromax](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-1322-5223/zithromax-oral/azithromycin-suspension-oral/details)) or [erythromycin](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/mono-15-ERYTHROMYCIN+BASE%2c+ERYTHROMYCIN+STEARATE+-+ORAL.aspx?drugid=3959&drugname=erythromycin+oral) ([Erythrocin](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-5390/erythrocin-as-stearate-oral/details))
		- Tetracyclines like [doxycycline](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-14449/doxycycline+oral/details)

> [!info]+ Mycloplasma bacteria do not have cell walls
> All mycloplasma infections have one thing in common though. Unlike other bacteria, mycloplasma do not have cell walls. They are also very small compared to other bacteria. That's important because many [antibiotics](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/rm-quiz-antibiotics-myths-facts) kill bacteria by weakening those walls. Since mycoplasma bacteria don't have them, some [antibiotics](https://www.webmd.com/cold-and-flu/video/josephson-antibiotics), like [penicillin](https://www.webmd.com/drugs/2/drug-3781/penicillin+g+benzathine+intramuscular/details), won't work against them.
