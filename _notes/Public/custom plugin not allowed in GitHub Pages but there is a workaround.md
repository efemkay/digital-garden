title: custom plugin not allowed in GitHub Pages but there is a workaround
tags: [Reference]
---

- #### GitHub pages doesnâ€™t allow custom plugin for security reasons, as such I cannot manually load regex_replace or markdown_highlight
	- alternative to this is to deploy using Netlify
	- thereâ€™s a repo that help with jekyll deploy action, but I havenâ€™t explore that
- #### For my markdown highlight issue, I will resort to [[replace == with mark for jekyll liquid]]
