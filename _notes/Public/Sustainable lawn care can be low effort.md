## Thrive to be sustainable
- #### Taking care of our lawn (big or small) doesn’t have to be big initiative but rather series of small actions
	- [[Grasscycling]] is a good example of small step by leaving grass cutting to decompose naturally and become natural fertilizer to your lawn
	- we can start with changing the norms, there’s no need to throw the grass cutting in landfill nor burn it (which will pollute)
- #### If we have to manage unwanted plants or weed, we can opt for non-pesticide approach like detaching
	- [[Dethatching]]
	- manually tending the lawn may sound high effort, but it provide opportunity to enjoy our lawn and count as physical activities

## Use Environmental Friendly alternatives
- If we have to use any chemicals, best to use what’s proven to be friendly to environment
