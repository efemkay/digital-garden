title: enable better R plotting in VSCode
---

- #### Enable `R > Plot: Use httpgd` is [[VS Code]] settings to have better support for R plots (especially multiple plot in single command)
	- Default VSCode plot for R is simplistic and does not contain similar features like in R Studio (especially for multiple plot in single command)
	- Require the httpgd library to be installed first. Run the following
		- `install.packages("httpgd")`
		- or alternatively install this compendium library `install.packages("languageserver")`
