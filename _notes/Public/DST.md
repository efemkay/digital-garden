- #### DST are well tests conducted with the [drillstring](https://glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/terms/d/drillstring) still in the hole.
	- these tests are usually conducted with a downhole shut-in tool that allows the well to be opened and closed at the bottom of the hole with a surface-actuated valve.
- #### One or more pressure gauges are customarily mounted into the DST tool and are read and interpreted after the test is completed.
	- The tool includes a surface-actuated [packer](https://glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/terms/p/packer) that can isolate the [formation](https://glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/terms/f/formation) from the [annulus](https://glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/terms/a/annulus) between the drillstring and the [casing](https://glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/terms/c/casing), thereby forcing any produced fluids to enter only the drillstring.
	- By closing in the well at the bottom, [afterflow](https://glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/terms/a/afterflow) is minimized and analysis is simplified, especially for formations with low flow rates.
- #### DST are typically performed on exploration wells, and are often the key to determining whether a well has found a commercial hydrocarbon reservoir
	- The most common test sequence consists of a short flow period, perhaps 5 or 10 minutes, followed by a buildup period of about an hour that is used to determine initial reservoir pressure. This is followed by a flow period of 4 to 24 hours to establish stable flow to the surface, if possible, and followed by the final shut-in or [buildup test](https://glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/terms/b/buildup_test) that is used to determine [permeability thickness](https://glossary.oilfield.slb.com/en/terms/p/permeability_thickness) and flow potential.
