title: five number summary give quick sense on data
---

#### Five-number summary help to give quick sense on data spread and skew
- Every distribution can be organized using a **five-number summary**:
	- Lowest value
	- Q1: 25th percentile
	- Q2: the median
	- Q3: 75th percentile
	- Highest value (Q4)
- These five-number summaries can be easily visualized using box and whisker plots.
	- This help to get better understanding on the data, especially since [[Low variability gives better predictability]]
	- For each of our samples, the horizontal lines in a box show Q1, the median and Q3, while the whiskers at the end show the highest and lowest values.
